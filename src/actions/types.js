//One file, all action types

//The value of the string does not have to equal to variable type
//E.G export const EMAIL_CHANGED = 'email_lalalala'
//We use const instead of default becuz there are multi var
export const EMAIL_CHANGED = 'email_changed';
export const PASSWORD_CHANGED = 'password_changed'
